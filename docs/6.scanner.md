Scanner operations
==================

Scanner are the most efficient way to retrieve multiple rows and columns from HBase.

Grab an instance of "Scanner"
-----------------------------

	var myScanner = hbase({}).getScanner('my_table');
	var myScanner = hbase({}).getScanner('my_table','my_id');

Or

	var myScanner = hbase({}).getTable('my_table').getScanner();
	var myScanner = hbase({}).getTable('my_table').getScanner('my_id');

Or

	var client = new hbase.Client({});
	var myScanner = new hbase.Scanner(client, 'my_table');
	var myScanner = new hbase.Scanner(client, 'my_table', 'my_id');

Create a new scanner
--------------------

	myScanner.create([options], [callback])

Options is an object for which all properties are optional. The following properties are available:

-   startRow: First row returned by the scanner
-   endRow: Row stopping the scanner, not returned by the scanner
-   columns: Filter the scanner by columns (a string or an array of columns)
-   batch: Number of cells returned on each iteration
-   startTime
-   endTime

Scanning records
----------------

	myScanner.get(callback)

Retrieve the next cells from HBase. The callback is required and receive two arguments, an error object if any and a array of cells or null if the scanner is exhausted.

The number of cells depends on the `batch` option. It is your responsibity to call `get` as long as more cells are expected.
	
	var callback = function(error, cells){
		assert.ifError(error);
		if(cells){
			// do something
			console.log(cells);
			// call the next iteration
			myScanner.get(callback)
		}else{
			// no more cells to iterate
		}
	}
	myScanner.get(callback);

Note, this is not very pretty. Alternatively, you could make use of the scanner function `continue` inside your callback to trigger a new iteration. Here's how:
	
	myScanner.get(function(error, cells){
		assert.ifError(error);
		if(cells){
			// do something
			console.log(cells);
			// call the next iteration
			this.continue()
		}else{
			// no more cells to iterate
			// delete the scanner
			this.delete();
		}
	});

Delete a scanner
----------------

	myScanner.delete([callback])

Callback is optionnal and receive two arguments, an error object if any and a boolean indicating whether the scanner was removed or not.
